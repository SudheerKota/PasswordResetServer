# General System Documentation
This directory contains all general (e.g. system architecture, release notes, etc.) Password Reset System documentation.
This directory should contain all general internal and external documentation related to the project, this means documentation related specifically to a system component (e.g. API Reference) should not be included.

# Build Process
